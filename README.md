Prep for Fantasy Baseball
These are my files I use to do some fantasy baseball research each year. Usually it involves extracting data from Baseball Savant and creating a few files that can be explored in Excel to uncover information on players that can't be from public online sources. Each R file is getting the data to present what I'd like to see and usually ends with me writing a csv file that can easily be explored in Excel.
